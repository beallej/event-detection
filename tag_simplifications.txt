#This file enumerates mappings that can be used to simplify POS tags.
#Any text after a '#' sign is a comment.
#Mappings are a comma separated list of tags followed by an arrow ('->') and a single tag.
#When a mapping is applied, all of the tags in the comma-separated list will be replaced with the tag after the arrow.
