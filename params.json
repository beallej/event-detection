{"name":"Event Detection","tagline":"Josie Bealle, Laura Biester, Phuong Dinh, Julia Kroll, Josh Lipstone, and Anmol Raina","body":"#About\r\nOne upon a time, a young visionary by the name of Jeff Ondich sat in his room reading the book Daemon by author Daniel Suarez. The book is about software created by a billionaire game designer and the goal of this software is to monitor current news. If it detects specific events in the news, it sets of a series of actions predetermined by the game designer. Now most people would have read this book and thought “Ah, that’s an interesting book”, but young Jeff detected a lucrative opportunity. He searched far and wide and assembled a team of six innocent college students to help bring this software to reality. Now, innocent that we were, we did not share Jeff’s dreams of world domination, however we did recognize the potential in such software. Think about the time we spend on articles or newspapers, looking for specific information about an event we are interested in. Instead you could enter a sentence into an app, and the app will notify you if anything about the event pops up in current news. Furthermore it will send you a list of the most relevant articles via text or email. Together, we created a piece of software that will make sure you never have to read the news again.\r\n\r\n##The Six Innocent College Students\r\n###Josie\r\nJosie grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio. The only news she reads consists of articles her friends linked to on Facebook and satirically summarized events published on [the Betches' website](http://www.betches.com/), although she isn't sure those constitute as news. Some of her favorite hobbies include obsessively checking Neko Atsume and watching Jane the Virgin.\r\n###Laura\r\n###Phuong\r\n###Julia\r\n###Josh\r\n###Anmol\r\n\r\n#Setup\r\n## Installations\r\n1. [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)\r\n1. Downloader (Run all commands from the root directory of the repository):\r\n  1. `./Setup_Teardown/setup_project.sh` - Handles psycopg2, Flask, and PostgreSQL. You may be asked to [download the JDK] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)\r\n    1. Note: If postgres failes to create the database (this sometimes happens if the createdb command is executed while postgres is still starting up), run `./Setup_Teardown/setup_project.sh -s true`.\r\n  2. `ant -Dprefix='./'`\r\n6. Auto-run: `./Setup_Teardown/install_crontab.sh`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Registrations\r\nCreate a file in the Utils folder named `Secrets.py`, with the following text:\r\n```\r\nimport sys; import os\r\nsys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))\r\nsys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))\r\n​\r\nfrom_email = \"\"\r\ntwilio_number = \"\" #use this format, ex. \"+19999999999\"\r\ntwilio_account_sid = \"\"\r\ntwilio_auth_token = \"\"\r\nsendgrid_api_key = \"\"\r\nbitly_api_login = \"\"\r\nbitly_api_key = \"\"\r\n```\r\nTo fill in empty strings:\r\n  1. Sign up for Twilio. Account SID and Auth Token can be found here: https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings. Phone number can be found here: https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming.\r\n  2. Sign up for SendGrid (they have to approve you, so it may take a while). After approval, go here https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys, generate an api key, and paste it in (the long secret version that is only displayed when you generate it).\r\n  3. Sign up for bitly. Go here https://app.bitly.com/bitlinks/?actions=accountMain. In the sidebar that pops up, click Advanced Settings -> API Support, and copy and paste in the api login and key displayed.\r\n  4. Input any email address to send from.\r\n\r\n## Running the Downloader, Validator and Pipeline\r\n1. Just do it. `java -jar pipeline.jar`\r\n\r\n## Running the Web App\r\n1. Run the application: `python3 WebApp/EventDetectionWeb.py`\r\n2. To view the application, navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)\r\n\r\n## After Pulling New Code\r\n1. Update Brew: `brew update && brew upgrade`\r\n2. Run Ant: `ant -Dprefix='./'`\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n1. Navigate to the Testing directory.\r\n1. Unzip `articles_test` folder. Alternatively, if using your own testing data, you can create your own folder of test articles labeled `articles_test`.\r\n2. Run `setup_project_test.sh`\r\n3. To use our test database run `create_premade_test_db.sh`. \r\n4. Various testing functions can be found in `Testing/Tester.py`. Make sure you run all programs from root project directory.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
