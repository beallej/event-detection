#### Registrations
Create a file in the Utils folder named `Secrets.py`, with the following text:
```
import sys; import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
â€‹
from_email = ""
twilio_number = "" #use this format, ex. "+19999999999"
twilio_account_sid = ""
twilio_auth_token = ""
sendgrid_api_key = ""
bitly_api_login = ""
bitly_api_key = ""
```
To fill in empty strings:
  1. Sign up for Twilio. Account SID and Auth Token can be found here: https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings. Phone number can be found here: https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming.
  2. Sign up for SendGrid (they have to approve you, so it may take a while). After approval, go here https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys, generate an api key, and paste it in (the long secret version that is only displayed when you generate it).
  3. Sign up for bitly. Go here https://app.bitly.com/bitlinks/?actions=accountMain. In the sidebar that pops up, click Advanced Settings -> API Support, and copy and paste in the api login and key displayed.
